# FART
FART, aka Framework for Application and Rendering Tweaks, is a high-level framework for building Windows UI tweaks and tools, similar to [WindHawk](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk) or [Powertoys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys), build from the ground up in C#.

## Why?
From my work on [TopCenterStart11](https://github.com/Naamloos/TopCenterStart11), I figured out playing around with Windows APIs in C# is kinda annoying. This framework aims to simplify the process, while also providing a simple management UI.
